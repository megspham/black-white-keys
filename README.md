## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I've never coded an app before, so this was a little challenging getting used to the syntax and seeing what additional features I wanted to put in. However, it's really fun 
and I didn't realize that it's less difficult than I had originally thought. In addition, I redid the project halfway through because I realized that I wanted it to 
resemble piano keys, so in a way the user would also be able to learn a little bit of music theory while playing! However, I really enjoyed working on the project because it was fun to implement and use my creativity
as I have been nonstop studying for my finals. This was a nice break, and I don't regret it, considering this is the first time I've actually completed a web development assignment! 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
How would I be able to publish my own web app without using third-party websites?
What are some apps I could create to make lives easier? 
What are more complex features I could use to improve a web app?
What could I do to make the website look more aesthetically pleasing and more smooth? 
How do I make the notes actual piano sounds? 
How would I be able to transfer this to mobile development? 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would definitely want to make the web app more smooth and interactive. It's fairly simple, but I would love the chance to make it look more aesthetic
and not as robust (if that's the right word). User interface is one of the most important features to the project, as it's what lures users in. In addition, I 
would've wanted to be able to change the piano notes into actual piano sounds.
